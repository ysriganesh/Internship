The report entirely focuses on the website, which is designed to store the details of
the Blast Furnace Process control log sheet which consists of different fields which
are required to be filled and those can be created, read, update and delete.
The creation of the log sheet is simple just by clicking create button where it creates a
form where the fields which are mandatory are to be filled and then the form is
created and stored in the database. Each form uniqueness is determined by the date,
shift and the BF field.
With the amount of time saved, the efficiency and productivity of the employees,
thereby, of the organization increases. The immediate display view of the created
form log sheet will contribute to all the positive changes. The main advantage of this
website is before this website was created the log sheet book was stored in a room
where if a person needs it they have to go take the book and if someone else already
has taken the book then he have to wait until he return whereas with the help of this
website created using PHP we can directly access the data through internet which is
very time saving. Here PHP is used as a middle end to retrieve the values entered and
to access the database and makes changes in it.
